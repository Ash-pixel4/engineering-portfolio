Comprehensive Guide to 40 Common Print Quality Issues</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This document serves as a technical guide for Customer Engineers,
press operators, and quality control personnel engaged in sheet-fed and
web offset lithography. It systematically addresses 40 prevalent print
quality anomalies, providing a diagnostic framework for identification,
an in-depth analysis of root causes, and actionable, field-level
corrective measures. The objective is to facilitate efficient
troubleshooting, minimize downtime, and ensure consistent adherence to
print quality standards.</p>

<h2 id="backing-away-low-flow">1. Backing Away / Low Flow</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Backing away, also known as low flow, is
a printing defect that occurs when the ink fails to transfer properly
from the ink fountain to the fountain roller. The ink, despite being
present in the fountain, does not flow sufficiently to replace the ink
that is being transferred to the printing plate by the ductor roller.
This results in a progressive starvation of ink to the printing
unit.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> The primary symptom of backing away
is a gradual lightening of the printed image across the sheet or web as
the press run continues. The print density becomes uneven and appears
faded or washed out in certain areas. A visual inspection of the ink
fountain will show that while there is ink in the fountain, it is not
making proper contact with the fountain roller.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ink is too short or
buttery</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The ink’s rheology is incorrect,
preventing it from flowing properly. An operator can modify the ink by
adding an overprint varnish or other approved additives to increase its
flow and length. Consulting the ink manufacturer for a formulation
change is the long-term solution.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Insufficient ink in the
fountain</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">A low volume of ink in the fountain can
lead to a loss of hydraulic pressure, preventing the ink from being
forced against the fountain roller. The operator should add more ink to
the fountain to ensure a consistent and adequate supply.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of fountain
agitation</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">On presses not equipped with ink
agitators, the ink can become stagnant and fail to flow. While not an
immediate fix, the long-term solution is to retrofit the press with an
ink agitation system. In the short term, the operator may need to
manually agitate the ink.</td>

<h2 id="backtrapping-contamination">2. Backtrapping / Contamination</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Backtrapping, also referred to as color
contamination, is a printing defect that occurs in multi-color printing
when ink from a previously printed unit transfers back to the blankets
of subsequent printing units. This leads to the contamination of the ink
colors in the fountains of the following units, resulting in color
shifts and inconsistencies in the printed output.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> The most evident sign of
backtrapping is a visible change in the hue of the printed colors. For
example, if black ink from the first unit contaminates the yellow ink in
the second unit, the yellow will appear muddy or greenish. This
contamination is often visible on the printing blanket and rollers of
the affected unit.</p>

sequence</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">In wet-on-wet printing, the inks should be
printed in a sequence of decreasing tack. If a subsequent ink has a
higher tack than the previous one, it will pull the previous ink off the
substrate and onto its own blanket. The operator should verify that the
inks are being used in the correct tack sequence.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fountain solution
issues</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An incorrect pH or conductivity of the

<h2 id="dot-gain">3. Dot Gain</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Dot gain, also known as Tone Value
Increase (TVI), is a phenomenon in which the size of halftone dots
increases from the printing plate to the final printed sheet. This
results in a darker, muddier appearance than intended. It is a natural
and unavoidable part of the printing process, but it must be controlled
and compensated for to achieve accurate color reproduction.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> Dot gain is identified by measuring
the dot area of a printed halftone tint with a densitometer or
spectrophotometer and comparing it to the original value on the printing
plate. Visually, excessive dot gain is apparent as a loss of detail in
shadow areas, a darkening of mid-tones, and a general lack of sharpness
in the printed image.</p>

dots and cause them to enlarge. The operator should check and adjust the
printing pressures to the minimum required for a clean transfer of
ink.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Incorrect ink/water
balance</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An excessive amount of fountain solution
can cause the ink to spread, leading to dot gain. The operator should
maintain a proper ink/water balance, using the minimum amount of water
necessary to keep the non-image areas of the plate clean.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Paper
characteristics</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absorbency and surface characteristics
of the paper have a significant impact on dot gain. Uncoated papers, for
example, exhibit more dot gain than coated papers. While the operator
cannot change the paper, they can adjust other press settings to
compensate.</td>

<h2 id="ghosting-mechanical">4. Ghosting (Mechanical)</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Mechanical ghosting is a printing defect
that appears as a faint, unwanted image or pattern in the printed area.
It is caused by issues with the inking system of the press, where the
rollers are unable to re-charge with a sufficient amount of ink in time
to evenly ink the entire plate cylinder. This is distinct from chemical
ghosting, which is related to drying and chemical reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> Mechanical ghosting is typically
visible as a lighter or darker area that mirrors the shape of a
previously printed element on the same sheet. It is most noticeable in
large solid areas or heavy tones. The ghosted image will be in the same
position on every sheet of the run.</p>

add a “take-off bar” to the edge of the sheet to help consume excess ink
and even out the ink distribution.</td>

<h2 id="hickeys">5. Hickeys</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A hickey is a printing defect that
appears as a small, unwanted spot or speck on the printed sheet, often
surrounded by a white or unprinted “halo.” Hickeys are caused by foreign
particles that adhere to the printing plate or blanket, preventing the
ink from transferring to the paper in that specific spot.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> Hickeys are easily identifiable as
small, sharp-edged specks in the printed area. The halo effect around
the speck is a key characteristic. The particle causing the hickey can
sometimes be found on the printing blanket. The shape of the hickey can
sometimes indicate its source; for example, a fiber-shaped hickey is
likely from paper lint, while a round hickey may be from a dried ink
particle.</p>

<h2 id="linting-and-picking">6. Linting and Picking</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Linting and picking are related printing
defects that involve the pulling of fibers or coating from the paper
surface during the printing process. <strong>Linting</strong> refers to
the accumulation of loose paper fibers on the printing blanket, while
<strong>picking</strong> is a more severe form where larger pieces of
the paper’s surface or coating are lifted away, leaving a void in the
printed image.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> Linting is identified by a gradual
build-up of fibers on the blanket, which can lead to a fuzzy or unsharp
appearance in the printed image. Picking is more obvious, appearing as
unprinted spots or voids in the printed area, often with the lifted
paper fragment visible on the blanket.</p>

<h2 id="metering-roller-build-up">7. Metering Roller Build-up</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Metering roller build-up is the
accumulation of ink, paper dust, or other debris on the metering roller
of the dampening system. This build-up interferes with the roller’s
ability to meter a consistent and even film of fountain solution to the
printing plate, leading to various ink and water balance problems.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> A visual inspection of the metering
roller will reveal a visible accumulation of residue. This build-up can
be uneven and may have a glazed or shiny appearance. The print quality
will be inconsistent, with symptoms such as scumming, tinting, or
emulsification appearing intermittently.</p>

<h2 id="misting-or-slinging">8. Misting or Slinging</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Ink misting, also known as ink slinging
or flying, is a defect where the ink breaks into fine droplets and is
thrown from the rapidly rotating rollers of the press by centrifugal
force. This creates a fine spray of ink that can contaminate the press,
the surrounding environment, and even the printed sheets.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> The most obvious sign of misting is
a visible cloud or spray of ink around the printing unit. A fine layer
of ink will also be found on the press guards, floor, and other
surfaces. The printed sheets may have a slightly hazy or speckled
appearance.</p>

<h2 id="mottling">9. Mottling</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Mottling is a printing defect
characterized by an uneven, blotchy, or cloudy appearance in solid
printed areas. It is a non-uniformity in print density that can be
caused by a variety of factors related to the ink, paper, and press
conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> Mottling is identified by a visual
inspection of solid printed areas. Instead of a smooth, uniform color,
the area will have a speckled, grainy, or blotchy appearance. The mottle
can be random or may form a pattern.</p>

Widely</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> This refers to significant and
uncontrolled fluctuations in the pH and conductivity of the fountain
solution during a press run. The pH and conductivity of the fountain
solution are critical parameters that affect the ink and water balance,
plate life, and overall print quality. Instability in these parameters
leads to inconsistent and unpredictable printing conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> This issue is not identified by a
specific visual defect, but rather by a range of inconsistent print
problems, such as scumming, tinting, plate wear, and color variations.
The only way to definitively identify this problem is to regularly
measure the pH and conductivity of the fountain solution and observe
significant variations over time.</p>

<h2 id="poor-trapping---process-inks">15. Poor Trapping - Process
Inks</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Poor trapping is a defect in multi-color
process printing where a subsequent ink does not adhere properly to a
previously printed ink. This results in incorrect secondary and tertiary
colors (e.g., greens, purples, and browns) and a muddy or washed-out
appearance in the final printed image.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> Poor trapping is identified by
measuring the densities of the overprinted colors and comparing them to
the densities of the individual inks. A significant loss of density in
the overprinted areas indicates poor trapping. Visually, the colors will
appear weak and incorrect.</p>

<h2 id="slow-drying-and-slow-setting">16. Slow Drying and Slow
Setting</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Slow drying and slow setting are related
defects where the ink does not dry or set on the substrate within the
expected timeframe. <strong>Slow setting</strong> refers to the initial
phase where the ink vehicle is absorbed into the paper, while
<strong>slow drying</strong> refers to the final phase where the ink
hardens through oxidation and polymerization. Both result in an ink film
that is wet or soft to the touch, leading to problems such as set-off
and poor scuff resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> The most obvious sign is that the
ink on the printed sheets is still wet or easily smudged long after it
has been printed. This can be checked by a simple rub test. The sheets
may also stick together in the delivery pile.</p>

<h2 id="blanket-contamination">30. Blanket Contamination</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Blanket contamination is the
accumulation of foreign matter, such as paper dust, lint, or dried ink
particles, on the surface of the printing blanket. This contamination
interferes with the transfer of ink and can cause a variety of print
defects, including hickeys, spots, and voids.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> Blanket contamination is identified
by a visual inspection of the printing blanket. The surface of the
blanket will have visible particles or a build-up of residue. The

<h2 id="ink-emulsification">31. Ink Emulsification</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Ink emulsification is a condition where
the ink absorbs an excessive amount of fountain solution, forming a
water-in-ink emulsion. A certain amount of emulsification is necessary
for the lithographic process, but when it becomes excessive, it can lead
to a variety of print problems, including weak colors, poor drying, and
a loss of print quality.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> Excessively emulsified ink will
appear weak, soupy, and may have a greasy or shiny appearance on the
rollers. The printed image will be low in density and may have a
washed-out look. The ink may also take an unusually long time to
dry.</p>

<h2 id="chalking">33. Chalking</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Chalking is a printing defect where the
ink pigment does not bind properly to the substrate and can be easily
rubbed off as a dry, powdery substance, similar to chalk. This occurs
when the ink vehicle is absorbed too rapidly into the paper, leaving the
pigment behind on the surface without a binder to hold it in place.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> Chalking is identified by rubbing
the printed surface with a finger or a cloth. If a powdery residue of
pigment is easily removed, the ink is chalking. The printed image will
also have a dull, lifeless appearance.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Show-through is a printing defect where
the printed image on one side of a sheet is visible from the reverse
side. This is not to be confused with strike-through, where the ink
actually penetrates through the paper. Show-through is a result of the
paper’s lack of opacity.</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong> Show-through is identified by
viewing the unprinted side of a sheet and seeing a faint image of the
